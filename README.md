# AI Commerce Agent

An intelligent, AI-powered shopping assistant that provides a conversational commerce experience similar to Amazon Rufus. The agent helps users discover products through natural language conversations, text-based recommendations, and image-based search.

## ‚ú® Core Features

1. **General Conversation** - Natural language chat about the agent's capabilities ("What can you help me with?")

2. **Text-Based Product Recommendation** - Intelligent product search from queries ("I need a waterproof jacket for hiking")

3. **Image-Based Product Search** - Upload an image to find similar products (Upload shoe photo ‚Üí find similar styles)

## üèó Architecture Decisions

### **Unified Agent Design**
- Single AI agent handles all three features rather than separate specialized agents
- Consistent personality and behavior across all interaction modes
- Shared system prompt ensures uniform experience

### **Separation of Concerns**
- **Commerce Backend**: Simple data retrieval layer (Convex)
  - Vector search for products
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - No business logic
- **AI Layer**: All intelligence and decision-making (OpenAI Realtime API)
  - Intent understanding
  - Product comparison logic
  - Recommendation algorithms
  - Conversation management

### **Tool Design Philosophy**
- Backend provides only data retrieval tools
- AI handles all reasoning, comparisons, and recommendations

### **Image Search Strategy**
- User uploads image ‚Üí OpenAI Vision API for description
- Generate text embedding from description
- Use same vector search infrastructure as text queries
- Unified search experience regardless of input type

### **Voice Mode Architecture**
- ChatGPT-like experience with dedicated voice mode
- Press button to enter voice conversation
- Exit to see full transcript in chat
- Uses OpenAI Realtime API with same tools and system prompt as text mode
